step 1 
    create 9 divs in 3*3 grid
step 2 
    add event listner to detect clicks
    `.addEventListener("click", function () {}})`
step 3 
    turn those clicks into inputing an X one turn and then an O the next turn ulternating between the two when clicked 
    `if (X was previous run step 4){next person play}`
step 4 
    check to see if there are 3 in a row after every input of X or O to see if someone has won. 
    something like this to track if 
    function whoWon(event) {
        var boxClicked = event.target)
        if(X !== 3){        
        }
        else if() {
        }
        else{ 
        }
        if (X or O === 3){
            show winner
        }}
    if no winner then go to next player 
    if winner then display win text/or annimation if enough themeing time.
